# Changelog

Notable changes to this project. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow SemVer.
Each entry is marked **[science]** if it changes a reported number, or
**[engineering]** if it does not.

## [Unreleased] (v0.2)

### Changed

- [engineering] Study names follow Supplementary Table S5 (`P1-scaling`, `P2-distance`,
  `P4-readout-balanced`, `ESN-balanced`, `B1-balanced`, ...). Runs are named
  `<study>-best[-<variant>]`; the ablation condition `baseline` is now `full`.
- [engineering] Working outputs are written under `results/` (`optuna/`, `runs/`,
  `metrics/`, `figures/`) and log files under `logs/`. Paths and settings come from
  `utils/config.py` (environment variable, then `config.env`, then default).
  `BIORESERVOIR_RESULTS_DIR` now names the results root rather than the runs folder.

### Added

- [engineering] `--archive VERSION` reads frozen studies from `archive/<version>/`.

### Fixed

- [engineering] Trial metadata no longer records the host name, IP address, working
  directory, or script, output and interpreter paths, and the platform string keeps only
  the OS, numeric kernel release and architecture. Trials now record the full git SHA, a
  dirty flag, the OS name and version, and an optional machine label from `config.env`.
